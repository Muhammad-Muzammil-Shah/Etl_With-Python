# **ETL with Python: Acquiring and Processing Information on the World's Largest Banks**

This project demonstrates the creation of a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python to acquire, process, and store information on the world's largest banks.

---

## **Project Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase the implementation of ETL processes, including data extraction, transformation, and storage, along with logging and database query execution.

### **Key Features**
- Comprehensive logging functionality for process tracking.
- Data extraction from reliable sources.
- Transformation of raw data into a structured format.
- Storage of processed data in CSV and database formats.
- Dynamic SQL query execution on the stored data.
- Verification of logs for accuracy and completeness.

---

## **Pipeline Tasks**

### **1. Logging Function**
- Developed a robust logging mechanism to record pipeline activities, errors, and execution details.

### **2. Data Extraction**
- Implemented scripts to retrieve raw data from designated sources.

### **3. Data Transformation**
- Cleaned, normalized, and structured data for downstream processing using Python libraries.

### **4. Data Loading to CSV**
- Exported the transformed data to CSV files for accessibility and reporting.

### **5. Data Loading to Database**
- Stored the cleaned data in a database for efficient querying and long-term storage.

### **6. SQL Query Execution**
- Created functions to execute SQL queries on the database, enabling analytical insights.

### **7. Log Verification**
- Verified log entries to ensure the accuracy and consistency of all pipeline processes.
